                        <p>Hacker Fellows is a one-year fellowship program where recent Computer Science college graduates work as a developer at a Michigan start-up. Hacker Fellows start with 5 weeks of cohort-based training before diving into Michigan start-up. Hacker Fellows are an elite group of developers passionate about making an impact through tech. Cool, huh?</p>

                        <p>An elite group of selected fellows will train in the Grand Circus classroom space in downtown Detroit over the course of five weeks. During this time, <em>Hacker Fellows</em> will acquire the entrepreneurial and technical skills needed to work for an amazing start-up in Michigan. Fellows will also develop a strong cohort of peers and start-up junkies. By being immersed in the start-up ecosystem, Fellows will create relationships and develop a firm understanding of the business side of start-ups.</p>

                        <p>Fellows will be thrown into the deep end and given the opportunity to make a huge impact on the high-growth high-demand tech sector. Fellows will be matched with a Michigan start-up following training and work as a developer for the remainder of the year-long fellowship. <em>Hacker Fellows</em> will also participate in ongoing mentorship and activities throughout the year. This program will provide the support required to create a "soft-landing" for recent Computer Science graduates coming to new cities in Michigan.</p>
