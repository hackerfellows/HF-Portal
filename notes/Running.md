# Basic Running
You can run a barebones version of the application with http-server. Make sure 
you've installed the `http-server` node module, then from the root directory, do

```
cd angularApp
http-server ./
```

This will run `app.js` using the `index.html` in the angularApp directory. 
MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FROM ROOT BECAUSE THAT IS INCORRECT.
